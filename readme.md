# **Clean Node API**

---

## [**Link to the course**](https://www.udemy.com/course/tdd-com-mango/?referralCode=B53CE5CA2B9AFA5A6FA1)

This API is part of professor Rodrigo Manguinho's (Mango) training at Udemy.

The objective of the training is to show how to create an API with a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD (test-driven programming) as a working methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities in layers, always following the SOLID principles and, whenever possible, applying Design Patterns to solve some common problems.
